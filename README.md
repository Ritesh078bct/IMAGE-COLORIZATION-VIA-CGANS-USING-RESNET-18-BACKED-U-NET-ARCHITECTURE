# Image Colorization via cGANs Using ResNet-18 Backed U-Net Architecture

## Project Overview

This project explores the fascinating problem of image colorization, transforming grayscale images into vibrant colored ones. We tackle this challenge using a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) architecture, leveraging the power of deep learning to synthesize realistic color information. Our generator is built upon a U-Net architecture, enhanced with a pre-trained ResNet-18 backbone for robust feature extraction, while the discriminator employs a PatchGAN approach to assess the realism of generated colored images.

## Features

  * **Conditional GAN (cGAN) Framework:** Utilizes a cGAN setup for stable and effective training, conditioning the generation process on the input grayscale image.
  * **ResNet-18 Backed U-Net Generator:** Employs a U-Net architecture with a ResNet-18 encoder for powerful feature extraction, followed by a decoder for upsampling and color channel prediction.
  * **PatchGAN Discriminator:** Incorporates a PatchGAN discriminator that classifies patches of the image as real or fake, promoting fine-grained realism in the generated outputs.
  * **Perceptual Loss (Optional but Recommended):** (If you've implemented this, add it. If not, consider it\!) Integrates a perceptual loss component using a pre-trained VGG network to guide the generator towards more visually pleasing and perceptually accurate colorizations.
  * **Diverse Dataset Support:** Designed to be adaptable to various image datasets (e.g., ImageNet, Places365, or custom datasets).
  * **Evaluation Metrics:** Includes scripts for evaluating performance using metrics relevant to image quality (e.g., PSNR, SSIM, FID if you've implemented it).

## Why ResNet-18 and U-Net?

  * **ResNet-18:** A relatively lightweight yet powerful convolutional neural network, pre-trained on ImageNet, provides excellent feature extraction capabilities. Its residual connections help mitigate vanishing gradients, allowing for deeper and more effective learning.
  * **U-Net:** Renowned for image-to-image translation tasks, the U-Net's symmetric encoder-decoder structure with skip connections allows the decoder to access fine-grained details from the encoder, crucial for high-quality image reconstruction. Combining it with ResNet-18 enhances its ability to learn complex mappings from grayscale to color.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

  * Python 3.x
  * PyTorch
  * Torchvision
  * NumPy
  * Pillow
  * Matplotlib
  * Tqdm (for progress bars)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Ritesh078bct/IMAGECOLORIZATION_VIA_CGANS_USING_RESNET-18_BACKED_U-NETARCHITECTURE.git
    cd IMAGECOLORIZATION_VIA_CGANS_USING_RESNET-18_BACKED_U-NETARCHITECTURE
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install the required packages:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    (You'll need to create a `requirements.txt` file by running `pip freeze > requirements.txt` after installing all dependencies.)

### Dataset Preparation

1.  **Download your desired dataset.** For example, you can use a subset of ImageNet or COCO.
2.  **Organize your dataset:** The `data_loader.py` script expects images to be in a certain structure. Typically, this means a directory containing all your color images. The script will handle converting them to grayscale as needed.
    ```
    data/
    ├── train/
    │   ├── image1.jpg
    │   ├── image2.jpg
    │   └── ...
    └── val/
        ├── image_val1.jpg
        ├── image_val2.jpg
        └── ...
    ```
    (Adjust `data_loader.py` if your structure differs.)

## Usage

### Training the Model

To train the colorization model, run the `train.py` script:

```bash
python train.py --epochs 100 --batch_size 16 --lr_G 0.0002 --lr_D 0.0002 --dataset_path ./data --output_dir ./checkpoints
```

**Key Arguments:**

  * `--epochs`: Number of training epochs.
  * `--batch_size`: Batch size for training.
  * `--lr_G`: Learning rate for the generator.
  * `--lr_D`: Learning rate for the discriminator.
  * `--dataset_path`: Path to your dataset directory.
  * `--output_dir`: Directory to save model checkpoints and generated samples.
  * `--gpu_id`: (Optional) Specify GPU ID if you have multiple GPUs (e.g., `--gpu_id 0`).

### Generating Colorized Images

Once you have a trained model checkpoint, you can generate colorized images:

```bash
python generate.py --checkpoint_path ./checkpoints/generator_epoch_100.pth --input_image_path ./test_images/grayscale_input.jpg --output_image_path ./output_images/colorized_output.jpg
```

**Key Arguments:**

  * `--checkpoint_path`: Path to the trained generator checkpoint.
  * `--input_image_path`: Path to the grayscale image you want to colorize.
  * `--output_image_path`: Path to save the colorized output image.

### Evaluation

To evaluate the performance of your trained model on a validation set:

```bash
python evaluate.py --checkpoint_path ./checkpoints/generator_epoch_100.pth --dataset_path ./data/val --output_dir ./evaluation_results
```

This script will calculate metrics like PSNR and SSIM and save example colorized images from the validation set.
